I have started moving spd.gr to github pages. In other words...

* From: Paid-for web hosting with an insultingly low and hard bandwidth limit
* To: Free hosting, with a _much higher as well as soft_ bandwidth limit

No PHP support, which is a good thing cause that means I have to get my act
together and re-develop my content without it, which is something I've wanted
to do for years...

Plus, I get to experiment with technologies that are totally new to me
(e.g. Jekyll).
