Co-founder, steering group member and maintainer of the

Internet of Things.

I am the developer of its IPv6 multicast support
([some info here](http://blog.spd.gr/2012/04/multicast-support-for-6lowpans-with.html))
and I maintain a number of hardware ports, including the one for TI's
CC26x0/CC13x0 as well as the platforms powered by the older CC2538 System-on-Chip
(CC2538DK, Zolertia Zoul and OpenMote). Additionally:

* Developer of [Sensniff](https://github.com/g-oikonomou/sensniff), the
  open source "Live Traffic Capture and Sniffer for IEEE 802.15.4 networks".
* Collaborator/maintainer of [cc2538-bsl](https://github.com/JelmerT/cc2538-bsl),
  an open source serial boot loader project.
* Developer of Contiki's support for 8051-based devices, such as as the TI
  CC2530/31 and the Sensinode CC2430-based sensors. These ports are no longer
  maintained, but for historic purposes
  [here is some info](github.com/contiki-os/contiki/wiki/8051-Based-Platforms)
  and a related
  [blog entry](href="http://blog.spd.gr/2011/12/contiki-for-cc2530-with-uipv6rpl.html).
